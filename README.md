## Description

This all in one RESTful API application allows you to plan a workout around your fitness goals with easy to use meal generators, and fitness plan recommendations. Technologies used in this program include: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, handlebars, MySQL, insomnia core, sequelize, and NPM packages such as "fitness-health-calculations".

Models, routes, and our database were created in the back-end, to be used by handlebars to create the front-end. A user is able to login and personalize, organize, and choose their own workouts.

## User Story

As a wellness conscious person, I want to be able to organize my fitness goal in one place so that I can easily keep track of them.
